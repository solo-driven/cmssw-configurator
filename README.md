During my summer school at CERN, I developed an automated system to streamline the creation of CMSSW (CMS Software) configuration files. The project's goal is reducing the complexity and manual steps required in setting up these files, which are crucial for simulating and analyzing particle collisions in the CMS experiment. By utilizing tools like LAW (Luigi Analysis Workflows) for task pipelining and Pydantic for data validation, I created a Python-based framework that automates the configuration process of CMSSW, ensuring repeatability and efficiency. The project also integrated multiple layers of caching to decrease the runtime. Please view `Summer_School_Work_Report.pdf` for the project's setup, code structure, validation methods, and workflow management, along with potential areas for future improvement.
